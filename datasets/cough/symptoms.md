# Cough - Symptoms and Information

## Definition
A cough is a sudden, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs, often to clear the airways of irritants, mucus, or foreign particles. It's a natural reflex that helps protect the respiratory system.

## Types of Cough

### By Duration
- **Acute cough**: Lasts less than 3 weeks, usually from cold or respiratory infection
- **Subacute cough**: Lasts 3-8 weeks, often persists after respiratory infection
- **Chronic cough**: Lasts more than 8 weeks, may indicate underlying condition

### By Characteristics
- **Dry cough (non-productive)**: No mucus or phlegm produced
- **Wet cough (productive)**: Brings up mucus, phlegm, or sputum
- **Barking cough**: Harsh, seal-like sound, often in children with croup
- **Whooping cough**: Distinctive "whoop" sound after coughing fit

## Common Symptoms

### Cough-Related Symptoms
- **Frequency**: Occasional to constant coughing
- **Timing**: Morning, night, or throughout the day
- **Sound**: Dry, wet, barking, or whooping
- **Mucus production**: Color and consistency if present
- **Pain**: Chest or throat discomfort from coughing

### Associated Symptoms
- **Sore throat**: From repeated coughing
- **Chest pain**: Muscle strain from coughing
- **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing between coughs
- **Fatigue**: From disturbed sleep due to night coughing

### Mucus Characteristics (if present)
- **Clear**: Usually viral infection or allergies
- **Yellow/Green**: May indicate bacterial infection
- **White**: Common with viral infections

## Timing Patterns

### Morning Cough
- **Common in smokers**: Clearing overnight mucus buildup
- **Postnasal drip**: Mucus accumulated during sleep
- **Acid reflux**: Stomach acid irritation overnight

### Night Cough
- **Asthma**: Often worse at night
- **Postnasal drip**: Lying flat allows mucus to pool
- **Dry air**: Low humidity irritates airways
- **Acid reflux**: Lying down allows acid to reach throat

### Exercise-Induced Cough
- **Asthma**: Triggered by physical activity
- **Cold air**: Breathing cold, dry air during exercise
- **Overexertion**: Pushing beyond fitness level

## Warning Signs (Seek Medical Care)
