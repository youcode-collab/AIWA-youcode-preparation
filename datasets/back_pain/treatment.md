- **Avoid aggravating activities**: Heavy lifting, twisting, bending
- **Gradual return**: To normal activities as pain improves
- **Listen to your body**: Don't push through severe pain

### Hot and Cold Therapy
- **Cold therapy**: Ice packs for first 24-48 hours after injury
  - Apply for 15-20 minutes at a time
  - Helps reduce inflammation and swelling
- **Heat therapy**: After initial inflammation subsides
  - Heating pad, warm bath, or hot shower
  - Helps relax muscles and improve blood flow

### Positioning and Sleep
